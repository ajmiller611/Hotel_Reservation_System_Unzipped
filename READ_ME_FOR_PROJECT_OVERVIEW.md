	ASP.NET web application and C# windows form application for hotel employees
	Stores data in a SQL Server Database File
	Facebook and Google account login functionality

ASP.NET web application uses an external file to store sensitive information like Facebook and Google App login information,
database connection string, and email account information used to send confirmation emails. The AppSettingSecret XML config file
will have empty values on GitHub to protect sensitive information and be placed in the solution directory for presentation purposes.
In a business setting, this file would not be empty and would be placed in a directory outside of the solution directory to prevent
the sensitive information from being uploaded to source control and limit access to select employees.
